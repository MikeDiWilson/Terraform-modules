# Terraform Module: VPC Flow Logs to S3

Overview

This Terraform module enables VPC Flow Logs for a specified VPC and stores the logs in an S3 bucket. The logs help in monitoring network traffic, troubleshooting connectivity issues, and enhancing security by capturing all network flows within the VPC.

Features

Creates VPC Flow Logs for a specified VPC.

Stores logs in an S3 bucket.

Configures an S3 bucket policy to allow AWS VPC Flow Logs to write to the bucket.

Supports traffic filtering options (ALL, ACCEPT, REJECT).

Fully configurable via Terraform variables.

Usage

To use this module, include it in your Terraform configuration and provide the necessary variables.

Example Configuration:

module "vpc_flow_logs" {
  source          = "./path-to-this-module"
  vpc_id         = "vpc-12345678"
  s3_bucket_name = "my-flow-logs-bucket"
  s3_bucket_arn  = "arn:aws:s3:::my-flow-logs-bucket"
  flow_log_name  = "my-vpc-flow-logs"
  traffic_type   = "ALL"
}
